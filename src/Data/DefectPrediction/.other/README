Description
===========
We provide produce and process metrics for 11 open-source projects at file-level.
    Accumulo, Bookkeeper, Camel, Cassandra, CXF
    Derby, Felix, Hive, OpenJPA, Pig, Wicket

For each project, we provide 3 datasets (each dataset belongs to a major-release)
In the Summary Section, we include the release-date for each of the release. The
datasets are in CSV-format.

Extracted Metrics
=================
We extracted metrics from Java files. We removed unit-test files. we extracted
8 metrics from the pre-release period (independent variables) and 5 metrics from
the post-release period (dependent variables).

    Pre-release (Independent)
        lines                 : LOC of the file at the release-date
        cyclomatic            : Cyclomatic complexity at the release-date
        churn                 : Num. lines changed
        churn_adds            : Added lines
        churn_dels            : Deleted lines
        num_commits           : Num. pre-release changes
        num_developers        : Num. Devs working on the file
        num_pre_release_issues: Num. pre-release bugs

    Post-release (Dependent)
        num_issues            : Num. of post-release bugs in the file
        changed_lines         : Changed lines to fix post-release bugs
        mean_experience       : Mean developer experience **
        post_num_commits      : Num. post-release commits
        num_cochanged_files   : Num. cochanged files

** Experience is measured as the num. of prior commits contributed by the
   developer(s) fixing a file.
